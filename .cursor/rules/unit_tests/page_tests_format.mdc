- A test will be described as '[CURRENT CONTEXT], [ACTION] => [EXPECTED RESULT]'
- A test will use the pumpPage method from [test_utils.dart](mdc:test/test_utils.dart) to use fakes
- If our context need an authenticated user we can provide it directly
- We override GoRouter routing if we want to test navigation
- Our tests try to test the app from a user point of view. (Ex: we test tap on an card that increment a counter instead of calling directly the increment function called by the card)

Example : [signin_page_test.dart](mdc:test/modules/authentication/signin_page_test.dart)
