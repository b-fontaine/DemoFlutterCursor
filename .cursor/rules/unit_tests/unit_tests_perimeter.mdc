- Tests must be modified when the tested class has changed.
- All tests files must be created in the folder "test" at the root of the project. They must then follow the package tree of the tested file (for example, if we test the file lib/core/data/api/user_api.dart, the test file must be test/core/data/api/user_api_test.dart).
