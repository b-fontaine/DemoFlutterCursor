## TDD 

- Each testable classes (repositories, use cases, state notifier) must be developped using TDD (Test-driven development). It means following thoses steps :
  1. Create interface and empty implementation (ex: returning a default value or an exception)
  2. Create unit tests testing this empty implemetation
  3. Run tests, thoses tests must fail
  4. Implements empty methods
  5. Run tests, thoses tests must pass
  6. Optimise generated code
