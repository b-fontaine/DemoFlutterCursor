- Add "dart_import applied" at the beginning of the chat message.
- Always use package import even for our project files. Ex: import 'package:demo_flutter_cursor/core/data/entities/upload_result.dart';
- Comply to the always_use_package_imports rule
- Our package is named demo_flutter_cursor
- DO avoid relative imports for files in lib/
