- Add "task_management applied" at the beginning of the chat message.

## Required files and folders
  - .status/tasks: Current development tasks and requirements, source of tasks definitions
  - [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md) : Project progress and state
  
## Workflow steps
  1. Read task requirements, extract acceptance criteria and identify dependencies
  2. Update [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md) to mark the corresponding task as "In progress". If the task is not mentioned in @status.md, add it.
  3. Create all models required (dto, domain models, state, etc.)
  4. Create all interfaces required (api, repository, use case, etc.)
  5. Create empty implementation of interfaces with empty methods (returning dummy data)
  6. Create all tests files first, following TDD approach (unit test, widget test, etc.)
  7. Implements all empty methods with dummy data to pass tests
  8. Execute unit tests.
  9. Implements all methods with business logic.
  10. Execute unit tests and validate all tests are passing.
  11. Update [status.md](mdc:.status/status.md) to mark the corresponding task as "Completed".
