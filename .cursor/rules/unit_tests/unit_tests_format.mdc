- A test must be described as  '[CURRENT CONTEXT], [ACTION] => [EXPECTED RESULT]'.
- A comment "Given" must be added at the beginning of the test 
- A comment "When" must be added before the tested method is called by the unit test.
- A comment "Then" must be added before the test assertions.
- Use the method beforeTest or afterTest when possible.
- Instanciate the tested class using fakes (see [tests_fakes.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/unit_tests/tests_fakes.mdc))
