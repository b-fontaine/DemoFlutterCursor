- Use fake implementations in tests rather than mocks. 
- To create a fake of an API, implements the API interface (like [exemple_api_fake.dart](mdc:.cursor/rules/unit_tests/templates/exemple_api_fake.dart)). Use the same logic for Dao classes.
- Our fake doesn't rely on network.
- Our fake class is used only within our test.
- Our fake file is created in test folder and the same package as the interface (ex: lib/data/api => test/data/api)
- Our fake class must be updated everytime its parent class has changed.
- Fakes must be used for unit tests and widget tests.
